    "Let's consider the transcriptional process in which an mRNA $x$ is produced at a rate $s$ and degraded at a rate $k$. In addition to the simple birth-death process that we simulated in week 10, we will now consider a two-state model for the promoter (Random Telegraph process). This means that the promoter can switch from an active ($g=1$) to inactive state ($g=0$) and vice-versa with respective rates $k_{off}$ and $k_{on}$.\n",

    "Transcription in mammals often requires a more complicated telegraph model (promoter cycle), where the promoter state goes through an $ON$ state, and then sequentially goes through several $OFF_n$ state before returning to the ON state. For example with two $OFF$ states, it would look like: $ON\\,(g=1)\\longrightarrow OFF_1 (g=2) \\longrightarrow OFF_2 (g=3) \\longrightarrow ON (g=1)$. This is related to the fact that transcription events often show a refractory period, *i.e.* promoter tend to stay off for some amount of time before turning back on. \n",

    "1. Modify the above code to implement the promoter cycle with two $OFF$ state. First, use rates as in the example above with the following modifications: $s = 20$, $k = 0.02$, $k_{on-off_1} = 1/15$, $k_{off_1-off_2} = 1/60$ and $k_{off_2-on}  = 1/60$. Show some representative simulations. Plot both the mRNA and promoter state.\n",
